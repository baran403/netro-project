**Site Design Instructions:**
• Build a project portfolio website in Turkish, modeled visually and structurally after etimangroup.com.
• Use a light, professional aesthetic: clean white/navy backgrounds, subtle dark blue accent color, sans‑serif typography, spacious card grids, full‑width hero banners.
• The site should include:

Header with logo, main menu: Anasayfa · Kurumsal · Projeler · Referanslar · Haberler · İletişim

Hero area on the “Projeler” index—title, breadcrumb, case-study cards (image, project name, status e.g. “Devam Eden”, “Biten”)

Grid layout of project cards, two columns on desktop, stacked on mobile. Each card clickable linking to project-details page.

Project details page: large project banner image (hero), project name, location, client, status, date, project description paragraphs, gallery section.

Footer with contact info, address, social icons (FB, Insta, Twitter, YouTube), and corporate links (KVKK, Çerez Politikası).

Functionality requirements:
• Fully mobile responsive (desktop / tablet / phone).
• Navigation menu collapses into a hamburger icon on mobile.
• Cards use lazy‑loaded images (optimize mobile performance).

Content structure (data-driven):
• Homepage or “Projeler” index driven by an array of project objects, each with:
{ title, image, status, slug, location, client, date, description, gallery: [] }.
• Clicking a card navigates to /projeler/{slug}, populating details dynamically.

Stylistic guidance:
• Use sans-serif font families (e.g., Inter or Ubuntu)
• Primary color: navy (#002f53), secondary highlight: gold (#cfa93e), neutrals: white/gray.
• Maintain generous spacing, minimal borders, hover effects on cards.

Output deliverables for the AI:
• Provide basic HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks) or optionally React/Next.js template in Turkish but with English class names.
• Include a mobile-first CSS layout, grid system or Flexbox, responsive media queries.
• Use sample dummy data for at least 4–6 example projects with varied statuses (“Devam Eden”, “Biten”).
• Generate the folder structure: index.html, projeler.html, projeler/[slug].html, assets/images/, stylesheets, scripts.
